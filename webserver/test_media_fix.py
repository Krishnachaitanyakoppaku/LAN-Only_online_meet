    print("📋 CHANGES MADE:")
    print("1. ✅ Added comprehensive debugging to video/audio stream handlers")
    print("2. ✅ Enhanced audio context management with autoplay policy handling")
    print("3. ✅ Added automatic audio context initialization on user interaction")
    print("4. ✅ Improved error handling for audio playback")
    print("5. ✅ Added debugging to media sending functions")

    print("1️⃣ REFRESH BOTH BROWSERS:")
    print("   - Host: Refresh http://172.17.213.107:5000")
    print("   - Client: Refresh http://172.17.213.107:5000")
    print("   - This loads the updated JavaScript with debugging")
    print()
    
    print("2️⃣ OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE (F12):")
    print("   - On both host and client browsers")
    print("   - Go to Console tab")
    print("   - This will show detailed debugging information")
    print()
    
    print("3️⃣ JOIN SESSION:")
    print("   - Host: Create session (should see debug messages)")
    print("   - Client: Join session with ID '172.17.213.107'")
    print("   - Both should see join success messages in console")
    print()
    
    print("4️⃣ ENABLE MEDIA:")
    print("   - Click somewhere on both pages (initializes audio context)")
    print("   - Enable video/audio on both host and client")
    print("   - Look for 'Audio context created' messages in console")

    print()
    
    print("If CLIENT is not receiving HOST media:")
    print("   1. Check if host is sending: Look for 'Sending video/audio data' in host console")
    print("   2. Check if client is receiving: Look for 'Received video/audio stream' in client console")
    print("   3. Check session IDs match in both consoles")

    print("If AUDIO is not playing:")
    print("   1. Look for 'Audio context created' message")
    print("   2. Check for 'Audio context suspended' warnings")

    print("   4. Look for audio playback errors in console")

    print("If VIDEO is not displaying:")
    print("   1. Check camera permissions in browser")
    print("   2. Look for video data length in debug messages")
    print("   3. Check if displayVideoStream function is being called")
    print()
    
    print("🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:")
    print("After the fix, you should see:")
    print("✅ Bidirectional video streaming (both directions)")
    print("✅ Bidirectional audio streaming (both directions)")
    print("✅ Detailed debug information in browser console")
    print("✅ No JavaScript errors related to media streaming")
    print()
    
    print("📞 QUICK TEST:")
    print("1. Open two browser tabs on the same computer")
    print("2. Host in tab 1, join in tab 2")
    print("3. Enable video/audio in both tabs")
    print("4. You should see/hear media from both tabs")
