# Screen Sharing and UI Fixes Applied

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Screen Sharing Fluctuation Issue ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem**: When server was sharing screen, client display was fluctuating between screen share and server video, causing a poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: The video display logic was treating screen frames and video frames with equal priority, causing them to compete for the main display area.

**Solution Applied**:
- **Screen sharing always gets priority** for the main display area
- **Server video is shown in the small preview area** (bottom right) when screen sharing is active
- **No more fluctuation** - screen sharing stays in main area, video in preview area
- **Dynamic header updates** to show what's being displayed in each area

### 2. File Sharing Buttons Visibility ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem**: File sharing buttons were not easily visible or accessible in the client interface.

**Solution Applied**:
- **Increased sidebar width** from 350px to 400px for better visibility
- **Improved button layout** with two rows for better organization
- **Enhanced button styling** with larger fonts and padding
- **Full-width File Manager button** for maximum visibility
- **Reduced heights** of other sections to make room for file sharing controls

## üìã Technical Changes Made

### Client.py Changes:

#### 1. Fixed Video Display Logic:
```python
def update_video_display_from_queue(self):
    # Screen sharing always gets priority for main display
    screen_frame_available = False
    
    # Check for screen frames first
    if screen_frame_available:
        # Show screen in main area
        # Show video in preview area (your_video_label)
    else:
        # Show video in main area
        # Reset preview area to local video status
```

#### 2. Enhanced UI Layout:
```python
# Increased sidebar width
sidebar = tk.Frame(video_container, bg='#2d2d2d', width=400)

# Improved file sharing button layout
first_row = tk.Frame(file_controls_frame, bg='#2d2d2d')
second_row = tk.Frame(file_controls_frame, bg='#2d2d2d')

# Full-width File Manager button
self.file_manager_btn.pack(fill=tk.X)
```

#### 3. Dynamic Header Updates:
```python
# Header changes based on content
self.your_video_header = tk.Label(...)  # Dynamic header
# Updates to show "Host Video", "Remote Video", or "Your Video"
```

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Screen Sharing Experience:
1. **Main Display**: Always shows screen sharing when active
2. **Preview Area**: Shows server/remote video during screen sharing
3. **No Fluctuation**: Stable display without switching between sources
4. **Clear Labels**: Dynamic headers show what's being displayed

### File Sharing Experience:
1. **Visible Buttons**: Larger, more prominent file sharing controls
2. **Better Organization**: Two-row layout for better space utilization
