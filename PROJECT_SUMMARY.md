## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Setup**: `python3 setup.py`
2. **Start Server**: `python3 run_server_gui.py` (GUI) or `python3 run_server.py` (CLI)
3. **Start Client**: `python3 run_client_gui.py` (GUI) or `python3 run_client.py` (CLI)

### Entry Points
- `run_server.py` - Command-line server
- `run_server_gui.py` - GUI server management
- `run_client.py` - Command-line client
- `run_client_gui.py` - GUI client interface

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Networking
- **Protocol**: Custom TCP-based protocol with JSON messaging
- **Ports**: Configurable (default: 8888 for main, 8889-8892 for media)
- **Real-time**: Low-latency video/audio streaming
- **Reliability**: Heartbeat monitoring and automatic reconnection

### Video/Audio Processing
- **Video**: OpenCV-based capture, compression, and display
- **Audio**: PyAudio-based capture with noise reduction
- **Codecs**: JPEG for video, optimized for LAN transmission
- **Quality**: Adaptive quality based on network conditions

### File Transfer
- **Chunked Upload**: Large files split into manageable chunks
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload/download progress
- **Checksums**: MD5 verification for data integrity
- **Size Limits**: Configurable (default 100MB max)

### User Management
- **Authentication**: Username-based login system
- **Sessions**: Persistent user sessions with heartbeat monitoring
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control (admin, user, etc.)
- **Rooms**: Private/public room creation and management

## 🎨 GUI Features

### Server GUI
- Real-time server statistics and monitoring
- Connected users and active rooms display
- Server log viewer
- Start/stop server controls
- Network configuration

### Client GUI
