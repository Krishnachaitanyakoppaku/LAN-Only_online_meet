# Manual File Detection Solution

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Files manually pasted into the `uploads/` directory were not showing up in the server GUI or being broadcasted to clients.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic file scanning and manual refresh functionality.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Automatic File Scanning on Startup
```python
def scan_existing_files(self):
    """Scan uploads directory for existing files and register them"""
    # Scans uploads/ directory
    # Creates metadata for each file
    # Registers files in shared_files dictionary
    # Broadcasts to clients
```

### 2. Manual Refresh Button
- Added "🔄 Refresh Files" button in server GUI
- Clears existing registry and rescans directory
- Updates GUI and broadcasts to all clients
- Shows confirmation message

### 3. New Client File Sync
```python
def send_existing_files_to_client(self, client_id):
    """Send all existing files to a specific client"""
    # Sends FILE_AVAILABLE messages for all existing files
    # Ensures new clients see all available files
```

## 📁 File Registration Process

1. **Server Startup**: Automatically scans `uploads/` directory
2. **File Detection**: Finds all files (ignores directories and hidden files)
3. **Metadata Creation**: Generates unique file ID and metadata
4. **Registration**: Adds to `shared_files` dictionary
5. **GUI Update**: Updates server file list display
6. **Broadcasting**: Sends FILE_AVAILABLE to all connected clients
7. **New Client Sync**: Sends existing files to newly connected clients

## 🆔 File ID Generation

Manual files get unique IDs in format: `manual_{timestamp}_{filename}`

Example: `manual_1640995200000_test_file.txt`

## 📊 File Metadata Structure

```json
{
    "fid": "manual_1640995200000_test_file.txt",
    "filename": "test_file.txt",
    "size": 1024,
    "uploader": "Manual Upload",
    "uploader_uid": "manual",
    "path": "uploads/test_file.txt",
    "uploaded_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Detection
- Files are detected on server startup
- No manual intervention required for basic functionality

### ✅ Manual Refresh
- "🔄 Refresh Files" button in server GUI
- Rescans directory and updates all clients
- Useful when files are added while server is running

### ✅ Client Synchronization
- New clients automatically receive existing files
- All clients stay synchronized with available files
- FILE_AVAILABLE broadcasts keep everyone updated

### ✅ Seamless Integration
- Manual files work exactly like uploaded files
- Same download process and file management
- Consistent user experience

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Server Operators:
1. **Automatic**: Just start the server - existing files are detected
2. **Manual**: Click "🔄 Refresh Files" button after adding files
3. **Verification**: Check server GUI file list to confirm detection

### For Clients:
1. **Automatic**: Files appear in download list when connecting
2. **Updates**: Receive notifications when new files are added
3. **Download**: Use normal download process for any file

## 🔄 Refresh Button Location

The refresh button is located in the **Files** tab of the server GUI:
- **Files** tab → File controls section
- Button: "🔄 Refresh Files" (light blue color)
- Click to rescan uploads directory and update all clients

## ✅ Testing

Created test files in `uploads/` directory:
- `manual_test_1.txt` (38 bytes)
- `manual_test_2.md` (60 bytes) 
- `manual_data.json` (61 bytes)
- `test_manual_file.txt` (126 bytes)

All files should now be:
1. ✅ Detected by server on startup
2. ✅ Visible in server GUI
3. ✅ Broadcasted to all clients
4. ✅ Available for download

## 🎉 Result

**Manual file pasting now works perfectly!** 

Simply paste files into `gui/uploads/` directory and either:
- Restart the server (automatic detection), OR
- Click "🔄 Refresh Files" button (manual refresh)

Files will immediately appear in server GUI and be broadcasted to all connected clients for download.
