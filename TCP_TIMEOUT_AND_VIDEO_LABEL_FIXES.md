# TCP Timeout and Video Label Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TCP Receiver Timeout Error
**Problem**: "TCP receiver timeout - connection may be lost" messages appearing frequently

**Root Cause**: 
- TCP socket timeout was set to 30 seconds, causing frequent timeout messages
- No proper connection loss handling or reconnection logic
- Timeout messages were confusing users when connection was actually fine

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Reduced timeout**: Changed from 30 to 10 seconds for better responsiveness
- **Activity tracking**: Added `last_activity` timestamp to distinguish real disconnections from normal quiet periods
- **Improved timeout handling**: Timeouts during normal operation (no messages) are now silent
- **Connection loss detection**: Only report connection issues after 60 seconds of true inactivity
- **Automatic reconnection**: Added `handle_connection_lost()` and `attempt_reconnection()` methods
- **Better error recovery**: Increased max_errors from 3 to 5 for more resilience

### 2. Video Label Warning
**Problem**: "Warning: your_video_label not available for local video display" appearing repeatedly

**Root Cause**:
- Video display update timer started before meeting screen was fully created
- Local video frames were being processed before GUI elements existed
- Race condition between video capture and GUI initialization

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Delayed timer start**: Video display timer now starts only after meeting screen is fully created
- **Enhanced safety checks**: Added multiple layers of widget existence validation
- **Graceful handling**: Silent skipping when meeting screen isn't ready (no more warning messages)
- **Connection state checks**: Video processing only occurs when properly connected
- **Improved video loop**: Added connection checks in video capture loop

### 3. Additional Improvements

#### Connection Management
- **Socket cleanup**: Added `cleanup_sockets()` method for proper resource management
- **Reconnection dialog**: User-friendly dialog when connection is lost
- **Status updates**: Real-time connection status display in meeting interface

#### Video Processing
- **Queue management**: Better handling of video frame queues
- **Resource safety**: Video loops now check connection state before processing
- **Timing improvements**: Increased delays for auto-start media to ensure GUI readiness

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working even with temporary connection issues
- **User feedback**: Clear status messages and reconnection options
- **Resource protection**: Prevents crashes from accessing destroyed GUI elements

## Results

✅ **No more TCP timeout warnings** during normal operation
✅ **No more video label warnings** - silent handling when GUI not ready  
✅ **Automatic reconnection** when connection is actually lost
✅ **Better user experience** with clear status updates
✅ **Improved stability** with enhanced error handling
✅ **Resource safety** with proper cleanup and validation

## Technical Details

### TCP Receiver Improvements
```python
# Before: Frequent timeout warnings
self.tcp_socket.settimeout(30.0)  # Too long
except socket.timeout:
    print("TCP receiver timeout - connection may be lost")  # Always printed

# After: Smart timeout handling
self.tcp_socket.settimeout(10.0)  # More responsive
last_activity = time.time()
except socket.timeout:
    if time.time() - last_activity > 60:  # Only warn after real inactivity
        print("TCP connection inactive for too long, disconnecting")
    continue  # Silent during normal operation
```

### Video Label Safety
```python
# Before: Unsafe access
if hasattr(self, 'your_video_label') and self.your_video_label.winfo_exists():
    # Could still fail if widget destroyed between checks

# After: Multi-layer safety
if (hasattr(self, 'your_video_label') and self.your_video_label and 
    hasattr(self.your_video_label, 'winfo_exists') and self.your_video_label.winfo_exists()):
    # Multiple validation layers prevent crashes
```

The client now provides a much more stable and user-friendly experience with proper connection management and error handling.
