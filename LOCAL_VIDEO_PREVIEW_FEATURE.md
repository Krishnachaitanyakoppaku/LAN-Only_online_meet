# Local Video Preview Feature Added

## âœ… **New Feature: Client Can See Their Own Video**

I've added a local video preview feature that allows clients to see their own video without changing any existing functionality.

### **ðŸŽ¯ What's New**

**Before**: Client video was only sent to server/host, client couldn't see their own video
**After**: Client can see their own video in the "ðŸ“¹ Your Video" section while still sending to server

### **ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation**

#### **New Methods Added**:

```python
def update_local_video_preview(self, frame_rgb):
    """Update local video preview (independent of main video system)"""
    # Updates the your_video_label with local camera feed

def clear_local_video_preview(self):
    """Clear local video preview when camera is turned off"""
    # Shows "ðŸ“¹ Camera Off" when video is disabled

def prepare_local_video_preview(self):
    """Prepare local video preview when camera is turned on"""
    # Shows "ðŸ“¹ Starting..." when video is starting
```

#### **Modified Video Loop**:

```python
def video_loop(self):
    # Capture frame from camera
    ret, frame = self.video_cap.read()

    # NEW: Update local preview directly
    self.update_local_video_preview(display_frame_rgb)

    # EXISTING: Send to server (unchanged)
    self.send_video_frame(frame)
```

### **ðŸŽ¨ User Experience**

#### **When Camera is Off**:

- "ðŸ“¹ Your Video" section shows: **"ðŸ“¹ Camera Off"**

#### **When Starting Camera**:

- "ðŸ“¹ Your Video" section shows: **"ðŸ“¹ Starting..."**
- Then immediately shows your live video feed

#### **When Camera is On**:

- "ðŸ“¹ Your Video" section shows: **Your live camera feed**
- Video is also sent to server/host (existing functionality)

### **âœ¨ Key Benefits**

1. **âœ… No Existing Functionality Changed**: All current video transmission to server works exactly the same
2. **âœ… Independent Operation**: Local preview works independently of main video system
3. **âœ… Real-time Feedback**: Client can see exactly what others see
4. **âœ… Professional Experience**: Like modern video conferencing apps (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
5. **âœ… Error-Safe**: Local preview errors don't affect main video functionality

### **ðŸ”„ Video Flow Now**
